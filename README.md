# Javscript-Based-Game
You will make a javascript game. It can be text-based or lightly graphical depending on your current skill level 
(if you've never done javascript before then do a text-based game but if you're an old pro then you should use 
some graphics and some basic MVC architecture).

I want you to use object-oriented paradigms in your code.

Here is a list of "themes", pick one and run with it:

Nothing to hide
Freefall
Down the river
Casual Connections
Circle of life
Expect the unexpected
Action and Reaction
