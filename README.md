# Javscript-Based-Game
You will make a javascript game. It can be text-based or lightly graphical depending on your current skill level 
(if you've never done javascript before then do a text-based game but if you're an old pro then you should use 
some graphics and some basic MVC architecture).

I want you to use object-oriented paradigms in your code.

Here is a list of "themes", pick one and run with it:

Nothing to hide
Freefall
Down the river
Casual Connections
Circle of life
Expect the unexpected
Action and Reaction

Theme: "Casual Connections" memory matching
- The twist or unexpected could be that players have to match sounds

- Or maybe certain sounds can also be related to an image (so instead
- of matching image to image, we can have sounds match to images; like
- a lion roar and a picture of a lion)
